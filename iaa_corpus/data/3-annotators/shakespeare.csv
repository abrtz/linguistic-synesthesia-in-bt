Marca temporal;their substance still lives sweet;your sweet semblance to some other give;and you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill;a closet never pierced with crystal eyes;through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay;a woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted;I impair not beauty being mute;sweet love, renew thy force;what strained touches rhetoric can lend;sweet flattery;as those gold candles fix’d in heaven’s air: let them say more that like of hearsay well;kissing with golden face the meadows green;that sweet odour;dumb presagers of my speaking breast, who plead for love, and look for recompense;as sweet-season’d showers are to the ground;to hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit;a crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air;and puts apparel on my tatter’d loving;my love is as fair as any mother’s child, though not so bright;my sweet love’s beauty;the sessions of sweet silent thought;sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines;scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye;more than that tongue that more hath more express’d;my saucy bark;hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke;the wide world and all her fading sweets;my sun one early morn did shine, with all triumphant splendour on my brow;thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness;the perfumed tincture of the roses
