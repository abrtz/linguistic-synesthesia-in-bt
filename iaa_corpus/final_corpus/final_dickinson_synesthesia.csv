"A fine, pedantic sunshine in a satin vest ",vision
"A silence suffuses the story, and a softness the teller’s eye",hearing
And sore must be the storm,touch
Anecdotes of air in dungeons have sometimes proved deadly sweet!,hearing
But just to hear the grace depart,hearing
Cherries suit robins,taste
Crackling with fever,hearing
Dare you see a soul at the white heat?,vision
"Demur,--you’re straightway dangerous, and handled with a chain",touch
"Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul, and sings the tune without the words, and never stops at all ",hearing
"How orderly the kitchen ‘d look by night, with just a clock,--",vision
"I like to see it lap the miles, and lick the valleys up",taste
I've heard it in the chillest land,touch
Is entombed so still that only to the ear of God its doom is audible ,hearing
It is a faded meat,vision
"It might be famine all around, I could not miss an ear",taste
"My country need not change her gown, her triple suit as sweet as when ‘t was cut at Lexington, and first pronounced “a fit.”",vision
Nor constellation burn,vision
Nor noticed that the ebbing day flowed silver to the west ,vision
Sharp pittances of years,touch
Sweetest in the gale is heard,hearing
"That defies me,--as a hand did try to chalk the sun ",vision
The eagle's golden breakfast,vision
The hands still hug the tardy glass,touch
"The needle to the north degree wades so, through polar air ",touch
"The ocean's heart too smooth, too blue",vision
The palate of hate departs,taste
This is the errand of the eye,vision
"Victory comes late, and is held low to freezing lips too rapt with frost to take it. How sweet it would have tasted, just a drop! ",taste
Yet to my irritated ear an anodyne so sweet ,hearing
