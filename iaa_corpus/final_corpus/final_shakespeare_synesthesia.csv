I impair not beauty being mute,vision
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes,vision
a crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air,vision
a woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted,vision
and puts apparel on my tatter’d loving,touch
"and you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill",taste
as sweet-season’d showers are to the ground,touch
as those gold candles fix’d in heaven’s air: let them say more that like of hearsay well,vision
"dumb presagers of my speaking breast, who plead for love, and look for recompense",hearing
hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke,smell
kissing with golden face the meadows green,touch
more than that tongue that more hath more express’d,hearing
"my love is as fair as any mother’s child, though not so bright",vision
my saucy bark,vision
"my sun one early morn did shine, with all triumphant splendour on my brow",vision
my sweet love’s beauty,vision
"scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye",vision
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,touch
sweet flattery,hearing
"sweet love, renew thy force",taste
that sweet odour,smell
the perfumed tincture of the roses,smell
the sessions of sweet silent thought,hearing
the wide world and all her fading sweets,taste
their substance still lives sweet,taste
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay,vision
"thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness",vision
to hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit,hearing
what strained touches rhetoric can lend,touch
your sweet semblance to some other give,taste
