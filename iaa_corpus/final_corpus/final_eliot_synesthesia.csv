A dull head among windy spaces.,vision
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.,vision
Ascending from the damp savannas,touch
"But through the water pale and thin 
Still shine the unoffending feet",vision
Defunctive music under sea,hearing
"Every street lamp that I pass 
Beats like a fatalistic drum",hearing
"Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired
Reiterates some worn-out common song
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden",hearing
Faced by the snarled and yelping seas.,hearing
"Gull against the wind, in the windy straits 
Of Belle Isle",vision
He is merely flesh and blood.,vision
"Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old Cologne",smell
I shall wear white flannel trousers,vision
Performing on a harp of gold.,hearing
Swaddled with darkness,vision
"The morning comes to consciousness 
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street",smell
"The reminiscence comes
Of sunless dry geraniums",vision
"The secret of its skeleton,
Stiff and white.",vision
The silent man in mocha brown,vision
The silent vertebrate in brown,vision
The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,vision
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,vision
These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.,vision
Under a windy knob.,vision
"Views of the Oxford Colleges
Lay on the table, with the knitting.",vision
Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,vision
White feathers in the snow,vision
clasped the yellow soles of feet,touch
hushed the shrunken seas,hearing
"let the rocks 
Groan with continual surges",hearing
the floors of silent seas.,hearing
