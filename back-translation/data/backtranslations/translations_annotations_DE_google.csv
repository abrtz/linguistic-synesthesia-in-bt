Timestamp,A dull head in the middle of windy expanses.,A fine pedantic ray of sunshine in a satin vest,A lonely cab horse steams and stamps.,Silence fills the story and gentleness fills the narrator's gaze,And the storm must be bad,Anecdotes about the air in dungeons have sometimes proven deadly sweet!,Rising from the damp savannahs,But just to hear the grace go,But pale and thin because of the water The harmless feet still shine,Crackling with fever,Do you dare to see a single human soul in this white heat?,Defunct music under the sea,Every street lamp I pass Beats like a fatalistic drum,Except when a street piano mechanical and tired Repeats a hackneyed song With the scent of hyacinths through the garden,In the face of the rough and roaring sea.,Her hand turns a paper rose This smells of dust and old cologne,Hope is the thing with feathers that sits in the soul and sings the melody without words and never stops,I do not spoil the beauty by being silent,I like to see it cover the kilometers and lick up the valleys,I will wear white flannel pants,I heard it in the coolest country,Is buried so quietly that only the ear of God can hear his fate,It is a faded flesh,There could be a famine everywhere I couldnâ€™t miss a single spikelet,"My country needs no change of dress its triple suit is as sweet as when it was cut at Lexington and first pronounced ""fitting.""",Still constellation burns,Nor did I notice that the evening day flowed silver to the west,Playing a harp made of gold.,Wrapped in darkness,The sweetest thing to hear is in the storm,This disgusts me like a hand trying to cover the sun with chalk,The heart of the ocean is too smooth too blue,The palate of hate disappears,The memory comes From sunless dry geraniums,The secret of his skeleton Stiff and white.,The silent man in mocha brown,The silent vertebrate in brown,The yellow mist rubbing its back against the window panes,The yellow smoke rubbing its mouth against the window panes,Under a windy button.,Views of the Oxford Colleges Place on the table with the knitting.,Where worried bodies of drowned men float down in the green silence,But to my irritated ear such a sweet pain,A closet that has never been pierced by crystal eyes,a crow flying in the sweetest air in heaven,A woman's face painted by nature's hand,"and you must live, attracted by your own sweet skill",like sweet showers of rain on the ground,like those golden candles fixed in the air of heaven: let them say more than hearsay,Silent harbingers of my speaking breast begging for love and waiting for reward ,Hide your bravery in their foul smoke,calmed the shrunken seas,kiss the green meadows with a golden face,let the rocks Moaning with sustained thrusts,"My love is as beautiful as a mother's child, although not as radiant",my cheeky bark,The beauty of my sweet love,"barely greet me with this sun, your eye","Sometimes it is too hot, the eye of the sky shines",sweet flattery,"sweet love, renew your strength",that sweet smell,the bottom of quiet seas.,the perfumed tincture of roses,the sessions of sweet silent thoughts,the wide world and all its fading sweets,Its substance still lives sweetly,your hungry eyes until they blink with fullness,Listening with your eyes is part of the subtle joke of love,Give your sweet looks to someone else
