Timestamp,A dull head among windy spaces.,"A fine, pedantic sunshine in a satin vest",A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.,"A silence suffuses the story, and a softness the teller’s eye",And sore must be the storm,Anecdotes of air in dungeons have sometimes proved deadly sweet!,Ascending from the damp savannas,But just to hear the grace depart,But through the water pale and thin Still shine the unoffending feet,Cherries suit robins,Crackling with fever,Dare you see a soul at the white heat?,Defunctive music under sea,"Demur,--you’re straightway dangerous, and handled with a chain",Every street lamp that I pass Beats like a fatalistic drum,"Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired
Reiterates some worn-out common song
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden",Faced by the snarled and yelping seas.,"Gull against the wind, in the windy straits Of Belle Isle",He is merely flesh and blood.,"Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old Cologne","Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul, and sings the tune without the words, and never stops at all","How orderly the kitchen ‘d look by night, with just a clock,--",I impair not beauty being mute,"I like to see it lap the miles, and lick the valleys up",I shall wear white flannel trousers,I've heard it in the chillest land,Is entombed so still that only to the ear of God its doom is audible,It is a faded meat,"It might be famine all around, I could not miss an ear","My country need not change her gown, her triple suit as sweet as when ‘t was cut at Lexington, and first pronounced “a fit.”",Nor constellation burn,Nor noticed that the ebbing day flowed silver to the west,Performing on a harp of gold.,Sharp pittances of years,Swaddled with darkness,Sweetest in the gale is heard,"That defies me,--as a hand did try to chalk the sun",The eagle's golden breakfast,The hands still hug the tardy glass,"The morning comes to consciousness Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street","The needle to the north degree wades so, through polar air","The ocean's heart too smooth, too blue",The palate of hate departs,"The reminiscence comes
Of sunless dry geraniums","The secret of its skeleton,
Stiff and white.",The silent man in mocha brown,The silent vertebrate in brown,The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.,This is the errand of the eye,Under a windy knob.,"Victory comes late, and is held low to freezing lips too rapt with frost to take it. How sweet it would have tasted, just a drop!","Views of the Oxford Colleges
Lay on the table, with the knitting.",Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,White feathers in the snow,Yet to my irritated ear an anodyne so sweet,a closet never pierced with crystal eyes,a crow that flies in heaven’s sweetest air,a woman’s face with nature’s own hand painted,and puts apparel on my tatter’d loving,"and you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill",as sweet-season’d showers are to the ground,as those gold candles fix’d in heaven’s air: let them say more that like of hearsay well,clasped the yellow soles of feet,"dumb presagers of my speaking breast, who plead for love, and look for recompense",hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke,hushed the shrunken seas,kissing with golden face the meadows green,let the rocks Groan with continual surges,more than that tongue that more hath more express’d,"my love is as fair as any mother’s child, though not so bright",my saucy bark,"my sun one early morn did shine, with all triumphant splendour on my brow",my sweet love’s beauty,"scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye",sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,sweet flattery,"sweet love, renew thy force",that sweet odour,the floors of silent seas.,the perfumed tincture of the roses,the sessions of sweet silent thought,the wide world and all her fading sweets,their substance still lives sweet,through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay,"thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness",to hear with eyes belongs to love’s fine wit,what strained touches rhetoric can lend,your sweet semblance to some other give
