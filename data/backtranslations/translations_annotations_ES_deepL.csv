Timestamp,A dull head between windy spaces.,"A fine, pedantic sun in a satin waistcoat",A lone horse taxi steams and stomps.,"A silence pervades the story, and a softness in the narrator's eye",And painful must be the storm,Anecdotes from the air in the dungeons have sometimes been deadly sweet.,Ascending from the wet savannahs,But only to hear the grace depart,"But through the pale, thin water Non-offensive feet still shine",Crepitus with fever,Dare you see a soul in the white heat?,Death music under the sea,For every lamppost I pass Beats like a fatalistic drum,"Except when a street piano, mechanical and weary
Reiterates some well-worn common song
With the scent of hyacinths in the garden","Facing the seas, growling and howling.","His hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old cologne","Hope is the feathered thing that perches in the soul, and sings the melody without the words, and never stops altogether.",I don't care that beauty is mute,I like to see how it travels the miles and licks the valleys,I will wear white flannel trousers,I have heard it in the coldest land,He is buried so still that only to God's ear is his doom audible.,It is a discoloured flesh,"There may be famine everywhere, I couldn't lose an ear.","My country does not need to change its dress, its triple suit as sweet as when it was cut at Lexington, and first pronounced ""a fit"".",Nor burn constellation,Nor did he notice that the waning day flowed silvery to the west.,Playing a golden harp.,Shrouded in darkness,Sweeter in the gale is heard,"That defies me,--as a hand tried to slate the sun.","The heart of the ocean too soft, too blue",The palate of hatred recedes,"Reminiscence comes
Of dried geraniums without sun","The secret of its skeleton,
Stiff and white.",The silent man in mocha brown,The silent brown vertebrate,The yellow mist brushing against the window panes,Yellow smoke rubbing its snout on window panes,Under a windy knob.,"Views of Oxford Colleges
On the table, with the fabric.",Where worried bodies of drowned men drift down in the green silence,"Yet, to my irritated ear such a sweet anodyne",a cupboard never pierced with glass eyes,a crow that flies in the sweetest air of the sky,a woman's face hand-painted by nature,"and you must live, drawn by your own sweet ability",like sweet rains to the ground,like those golden sails set in the air of heaven: that they say more than as by hearsay well,"mute forebodings of my speaking breast, that plead for love, and seek reward",hiding your bravery in its rotting smoke,silenced the shrinking seas,kissing with a golden face the green meadows,let the rocks Moans with continuous waves,"my love is as beautiful as any mother's child, though not as bright",my brazen bark,the beauty of my sweet love,"You just greet me with that sun, your eye",sometime too hot shines the eye of the sky,sweet compliments,"sweet love, renew your strength",that sweet smell,the floors of silent seas.,the scented tincture of roses,the sessions of sweet silent thought,the wide world and all its vanished sweets,its substance still lives sweet,"your hungry eyes, till they flicker with fullness",hearing with the eyes belongs to the fine wit of love,your sweet semblance to some other to give
