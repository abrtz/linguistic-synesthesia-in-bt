Timestamp,A dull head between windy spaces.,"A beautiful, pedantic sun in a satin vest.",A lone draft horse steams and kicks.,A silence permeates the story and a softness in the narrator's eyes.,And the storm must be painful,Dungeon air anecdotes have sometimes been deadly sweet!,Rising from the wet savannahs,But just to hear the grace depart,"But through the thin pale water
The harmless feet still shine",Crackling with fever,Do you dare to see a soul in the white heat?,Defunct music under the sea.,"Every streetlight I pass
It sounds like a fatalistic drum","Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired
Reiterates some worn-out common song
With the smell of hyacinths on the other side of the garden",Facing the growling and howling seas.,"Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells like dust and old cologne.",Hope is that feathery thing that settles in the soul and sings the melody without the words and never stops at all.,I do not deteriorate beauty by being mute,I like to watch him go for miles and lick the valleys.,I'll wear white flannel pants.,I have heard it in the coldest land,He is buried so still that only to God's ear is his fate audible.,It is a discolored meat,"There may be famine everywhere, I couldn't miss an ear","My country does not need to change its dress, its triple suit is as sweet as when it was cut in Lexington and it was first pronounced ""a fit.""",Not even a constellation burns,Nor did I notice that the waning day silver flowed westward,Playing a golden harp.,Shrouded in darkness,You hear the sweetest of the gale,"That challenges me, like a hand tried to chalk the sun.","The heart of the ocean is too soft, too blue.",The palate of hate moves away,"The reminiscence comes
Of dried geraniums without sun","The secret of its skeleton,
Rigid and white.",The Mocha Brown Silent Man.,The silent vertebrate in brown,The yellow fog that brushes your back against the windows,The yellow smoke that rubs its snout against the glass,Under a windy knob.,"Views of Oxford universities
Place on the table, with the fabric.",Where the worried bodies of drowned men float in the green silence,"Yet to my irritated ear, such a sweet nondescript",A never pierced cabinet with glass eyes.,a crow that flies in the sweetest air of heaven,A woman's face hand painted by nature.,"and you must live, drawn by your own sweet ability",As sweet season rains fall to the ground,"like those golden candles fixed in the air of heaven: let them say more than rumors, well","Mute omens from my talking chest, that beg for love and seek reward.",Hiding your bravery in its rotten smoke,silenced the shrunken seas,kissing the green meadows with a golden face,"let the rocks
Moan with continuous waves","My love is as beautiful as any mother's son, although not as bright.",my spicy crust,"You barely greet me with that sun, your eye",the beauty of my sweet love,Sometimes too hot the eye of the sky shines,sweet flattery,"sweet love, renew your strength",that sweet smell,the bottoms of silent seas.,the scented tincture of roses,the sessions of sweet silent thinking,the wide world and all its faded sweets,its substance still lives sweet,"your hungry eyes, even until they wink fully",listening with your eyes belongs to the fine ingenuity of love,your sweet resemblance to some other day
