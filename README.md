- generate final corpus with instances in which all human annotators agree.
- translate the positive cases of linguistic synesthesia into German and Spanish and translate them back to English

- calculate IAA after backtranslation with aggregated Cohen's kappa, aggregated Observed Agreement and Fleiss' kappa
- compute IAA between before and after back-translation.
